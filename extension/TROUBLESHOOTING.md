# ðŸ”§ AI Resume Screener Troubleshooting Guide

## Quick Fixes

### 1. Extension Not Working
**Problem**: Extension installed but not functioning on Keka pages

**Solutions**:
- Refresh any open Keka pages after installation
- Check that Developer Mode is enabled in Chrome extensions
- Verify the extension appears in your toolbar (pin it if needed)
- Try opening the test page: `file:///path/to/extension/test.html`

### 2. No AI Screening Button
**Problem**: Can't find the "ðŸ¤– AI Screen Resume" button

**Solutions**:
- Make sure you're on a Keka candidates page (not just any page)
- Wait for the page to fully load (extension injects after page load)
- Look for the floating AI widget (ðŸ¤–) in the bottom-right corner
- Try selecting candidates in the table first

### 3. API Key Issues
**Problem**: "API key required" or authentication errors

**Solutions**:
- Click the extension icon and configure your OpenAI API key
- Ensure your API key starts with `sk-` (not `pk-`)
- Check your OpenAI account has billing enabled
- Verify you have sufficient credits/quota

### 4. "No candidate information found"
**Problem**: AI screening fails to find candidate data

**Solutions**:
- Select candidates using checkboxes in the table
- Navigate to individual candidate profile pages
- Ensure the page has loaded completely
- Check that candidate data is visible on the page

## Advanced Troubleshooting

### Check Browser Console
1. Press `F12` to open Developer Tools
